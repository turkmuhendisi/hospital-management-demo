# Railway.app configuration for Advanced Dashboard
# Root Directory: teleradyoloji/web_dashboard/advanced
# IMPORTANT: Railway uses nixpacks builder with auto-detection
# DO NOT use subdirectory - requirements.txt must be in root directory

# Nixpacks will automatically:
# 1. Detect Python from requirements.txt (in THIS directory, not backend/)
# 2. Use Python 3.9 from runtime.txt
# 3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

[deploy]
# Start application directly (Railway already in repo root)
# backend/ renamed to app/ to avoid Railway auto-detection
