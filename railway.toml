# Railway.app configuration for Advanced Dashboard
# Root Directory: teleradyoloji/web_dashboard/advanced

# DO NOT use subdirectory - requirements.txt must be in root directory

# Nixpacks will automatically:
# 1. Detect Python from requirements.txt (in THIS directory, not backend/)
# 2. Use Python 3.9 from runtime.txt
# 3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

[deploy]
# Start command runs from teleradyoloji directory (3 levels up)
# backend/ renamed to app/ to avoid Railway auto-detection
